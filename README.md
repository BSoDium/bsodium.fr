## Overview

This repository contains the source code of my eportfolio, a React progressive web app which showcases my skills and projects. It is based on *MUI Joy* for UI components, *React Spring* for animations and *DALL-E 3* for illustration generation. Feel free to check out the latest production deployment at https://bsodium.fr.

This project is available for free as a proof of concept and source of inspiration, and was by design tailored to my personal needs. However, its generic structure and components could technically allow anyone to make it their own.

**If you are interested in using this project for your own portfolio, please carefully read the [License](#license) section.**

## Installation

### Frontend

This app uses several environment variables to configure the API url, Google Analytics tracking ID and Web3forms access key. You can create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:

```shell
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:3001 # The URL of the backend
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=UA-XXXXXXXXX-X # Your google Analytics tracking ID
VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX # Your web3forms access key
```

To run the app locally, you need to have Node.js and yarn installed on your machine. Clone this repository and run the following commands in the root directory:

```shell
yarn install # install dependencies
yarn start # start development server
```

In its default configuration, the app should be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Backend

For detailed documentation on how to run the backend, please refer to the [api.bsodium.fr](https://github.com/BSoDium/api.bsodium.fr) repository.

By default, the backend is expected to run on `http://localhost:3001`. If you decide to change this, you should also modify the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in the `.env.local` file accordingly.
