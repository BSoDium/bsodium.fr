## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT MERGE YET (2 PRs)

These PRs build successfully but have peer dependency conflicts that may cause runtime issues:

### PR #183: react-dom 18.3.1 ‚Üí 19.0.0 (and @types/react-dom 18.3.0 ‚Üí 19.0.4)
- **Type**: MAJOR version upgrade (React 19)
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Builds successfully
- **Peer Dependencies**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONFLICTS DETECTED**
  - `@emotion/react` expects React ^18.0.0
  - `@mui/joy` expects React ^18.0.0
  - `react` is still on 18.3.1 (react-dom upgraded to 19.0.0 creates mismatch)
- **Issues**:
  - React 19 includes breaking changes (new JSX transform required, ref as prop, etc.)
  - Current UI library stack (@emotion, @mui/joy) not yet compatible with React 19
  - Mismatched React versions (react 18.3.1 vs react-dom 19.0.0) will cause issues
- **Recommendation**: **CLOSE THIS PR**
  - Wait for @emotion/react and @mui/joy to release React 19-compatible versions
  - Upgrade React and ReactDOM together, not separately
  - React 19 requires ecosystem-wide updates - too early to adopt

### PR #199: vite 5.4.10 ‚Üí 6.3.5
- **Type**: MAJOR version upgrade (Vite 6)
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Builds successfully
- **Peer Dependencies**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONFLICTS DETECTED**
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react` version 4.3.1 expects Vite ^4.2.0 || ^5.0.0
  - Current plugin version doesn't officially support Vite 6
- **Issues**:
  - Plugin may work but is not officially compatible
  - Risk of runtime errors or build inconsistencies
  - New Vite 6 features may not work correctly
- **Recommendation**: **WAIT FOR PLUGIN UPDATE**
  - Close this PR for now
  - Wait for `@vitejs/plugin-react` to release Vite 6-compatible version
  - Re-open upgrade once plugin ecosystem catches up

## Testing Methodology

All PRs were tested with the following process:

1. **Branch Checkout**: Fetched and checked out each PR branch
2. **Dependency Installation**: Ran `yarn install` (with PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD for network restrictions)
3. **Build Test**: Ran `yarn build` to verify production build succeeds
4. **Peer Dependency Analysis**: Checked yarn output for peer dependency warnings
5. **Build Output Verification**: Verified all assets compiled correctly

### Build Environment
- Node: v20.19.5
- Yarn: 4.3.1
- TypeScript: 5.5.4

   and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.
   ```

   - **Action**: Track Sass 2.0 release, update when available

2. **ESLint Peer Dependency**:
   ```
   eslint is listed by your project with version 9.9.0, which doesn't 
   satisfy what @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin requests (^8.57.0)
   ```
   - **Impact**: None on runtime
   - **Action**: Can be addressed separately

## Conclusion

**Action Items**:
1. ‚úÖ Merge PRs #186, #187, #185 immediately - they are safe
2. ‚ùå Close PRs #183 and #199 - wait for ecosystem support
3. üìã Monitor for React 19 and Vite 6 plugin updates in the future

The 3 safe PRs bring valuable improvements and bug fixes with zero risk.
The 2 PRs requiring ecosystem updates should be revisited in 3-6 months.
